            <h3 class="firstclass">IMPORTANCE OF TECHNOLOGY</h3>
            <div class="visible-content">
                <p>We can't survive without technology in our daily life. We rely significantly on technology for every
                    other task we perform today. We are so reliant on it that we find it impossible to envision life
                    without it. In our homes, schools, and workplaces, we utilize many devices. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="invisible-content">
                <p>
                    You are aware of how technology connects people around the world. For instance, you can communicate
                    with people using technology like GPS, smartphones, and internet connectivity.
                    With the aid of technology, we are capable of anything. You must comprehend the significance of
                    technology if you wish to advance your profession. A nation's development, a person's growth, and
                    its GDP all expand with technology.<br>
                    * Technology Improves Efficiency<br>
                    * Technology Enhances Communication<br>
                    *Easy Information Access<br>
                    *Technology Helps In A New Business<br>
                    * Technology Saves Time<br>
                    * Technology Brings People Close<br>

            <h3 class="firstclass">ADVANTAGE OF TECHNOLOGY</h3>
            <div class="visible-content">
                <p>
                    *Production expansion:<br>
                    The technology enables manufacturing to rise several times over. The effort and energy of the
                    workforce are restricted. However, because machinery now operates at a greater level, production can
                    be increased. The task is completed by the machine more precisely </p>
            </div>
            <div class="invisible-content">
                <p>and accurately. Inconceivable with human effort, the items are equal in every manner. Humans have
                    used technology to help them generate cash on various occasions.<br>
                    * Time management:<br>
                    Thus, technology aids in huge productivity gains and time savings. We can finish essential
                    assignments faster. Everything is mechanized these days, and technology saves a lot of time by
                    carrying out tasks that people are unable to do. For instance, if you need more time to go shopping,
                    you may order goods online and have them delivered to your house. Consequently, one can use the time
                    for other vital duties by leveraging technology.<br>
                    *Technology enhances services:<br>
                    If you buy a television, and soon after, it breaks down. It would be helpful if you could set aside
                    your concerns over the TV's warranty coverage. You only need to contact the company or its customer
                    help to have your TV fixed. As a result, all that is needed to communicate now is a phone call or a
                    letter.<br>

                    * Easy and quick communication:<br>
                    * Reduces online fraud and cybercrime:<br>
                    * Has increased people's safety:<br>
                    * Improved storage:<br>
                    * Technology makes teaching easier:<br>
                    * Medical Care and Services:<br>

            <h3 class="firstclass">DISADVANTAGE OF TECHNOLOGY</h3>
            <div class="visible-content">
                <p> *Unemployment:<br>
                    The unemployment rate has drastically increased as technology has developed. People rely on
                    computers for all of their tasks as well as for their survival. The ability of a single computer to
                    quickly finish a substantial amount of work has also increased unemployment.<br>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="invisible-content">
                <p>
                    * Data security:<br>
                    In the modern world, some tech-savvy individuals have turned into hackers. Your data is not at all
                    secure with you as a result. They could hack your computer, bank accounts, office data, and much
                    more from the comfort of their home with the use of modern technology. Sharing OTPs and other
                    information online is dangerous now that there is a significant risk of fraud. Even one piece of
                    information posted online increases the risk that it will fall into the hands of hackers,
                    terrorists, criminals, and other foreign enemies.<br>
                    * People get distracted easily:<br>
                    People are frequently diverted from reading excellent material by using numerous gadgets. Young
                    people, adults, and children are all active on social media, which prevents them from carrying out
                    their everyday obligations. Since the majority of today's youngsters own a phone or laptop, it can
                    be difficult for them to focus on their studies.<br>
                    * Health concerns:<br>
                    In the modern world, people are so preoccupied with technology that they forget to take care of
                    themselves. This has diverse effects on their health. They experience numerous illnesses, including
                    obesity, insomnia, and vision problems. Some people use their phones as sleep aids. Due to frequent
                    phone checks, some people have trouble concentrating on their homework.<br>
                    *People become involved in seeing undesirable things:<br>
                    * Addiction:<br>
                    * Impacted one's social life:<br>
                    * Technology is costly:<br>
                    * Additional training is required:<br>
                    * Technology isn't always secure:<br></p>

            <div class="visible-content">
                <p>Healthy development is constrained and redirected through strategies including pinching buds,
                    trimming, and wire branches, as well as sparingly limiting but continuing to provide fertilizers.
                    Bonsai are not genetically shrunk plants, but are often kept at a height of under four feet (or
                    roughly one meter).</p>

                    food, and has smaller or reducible-leaf structures.so,in bonsai tree business technology have played
                    a vital role.I think without technology the business will 75% down.here are some of the way how
